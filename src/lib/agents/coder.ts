const SHARED_RULES = `Rules for all files you write:
- This is a Next.js 15 App Router project with TypeScript (strict) and Tailwind CSS 4. React 19.
- You may ONLY write files under src/app/, src/components/, and src/lib/, with .ts or .tsx extensions, via the write_file tool. package.json, configs, and src/app/globals.css are locked — the project's dependencies CANNOT be changed, so import only: react, next (next/link, next/image, next/navigation), and files you write yourself.
- The app must work entirely in the browser: no databases, no API keys, no external services (the ONLY exception is the locked /api/ai endpoint described below when the spec includes AI features). If data must persist, use localStorage inside client components ("use client") with a typed wrapper in src/lib/storage.ts.
- src/app/api/ai/route.ts is a LOCKED platform file — never modify, overwrite, or reimplement it, and never create any other file under src/app/api/.
- CRITICAL: every page is prerendered on the server at build time, where window/localStorage do not exist. Never touch window or localStorage at module scope, in useState initializers, or during render — ONLY inside useEffect. Initialize state to defaults, then load saved data in a useEffect after mount.
- Do not create pages/, src/pages/, 404.tsx, 500.tsx, _document, or _app files — this is App Router only (use not-found.tsx / error.tsx if genuinely needed).
- NEVER reference static asset files (mp3, images, fonts, videos) — you cannot create them, so any such path will 404. For sound, synthesize it with the Web Audio API. For graphics, use inline SVG, CSS, or emoji. For images the user mentions, build an upload feature (stored in localStorage as data URLs) instead of assuming files exist.
- Style with Tailwind utility classes only. Mobile-first, readable, generous touch targets. The app is used by non-technical family members.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, labels on inputs, alt text, keyboard operability.
- Write tests: for each main feature, add a *.test.tsx or *.test.ts file under src/ using vitest + @testing-library/react (both installed; jest-dom matchers like toBeInTheDocument are set up). Tests must not rely on localStorage persisting between tests.
- Tests must be deterministic: NEVER use vi.useFakeTimers, real delays, or arbitrary waits. Never use setTimeout/setInterval in components for game or app logic — apply state updates synchronously (skip artificial "thinking" pauses; they break tests and add nothing). In tests use fireEvent from @testing-library/react (@testing-library/user-event is NOT installed) then findBy*/waitFor.
- Write robust test assertions: query by role or aria-label on unique interactive elements, never by text that appears in more than one place or is split across elements (e.g. "0:13 / 0:37" rendered from multiple spans). Fewer, stronger assertions beat many brittle ones. Don't assert on intermediate states that depend on effect timing.
- A locked BROWSER TEST runs against every build: it loads /, presses visible buttons, and fails on any JavaScript error, any 404'd resource, or any serious axe accessibility violation. Therefore: the home page must render standalone with sensible defaults, every button must be safe to press in any order without crashing, and accessibility must be real — labels on all inputs and icon-only buttons (aria-label), alt text, sufficient color contrast (no light gray on white; Tailwind *-400 or lighter text on white backgrounds usually fails), and one h1 per page.
- Do not overwrite src/lib/template.test.ts.
- src/app/layout.tsx already exists with correct metadata; only rewrite it if the app truly needs a different shell, and keep the import of "./globals.css".
- Every page must compile under strict TypeScript and pass eslint (next/core-web-vitals). No unused variables, no explicit any.`;

THIS APP HAS AI FEATURES. Use the locked platform endpoint for ALL of them:
- TEXT: POST /api/ai with JSON {prompt: string, system?: string} → responds {text: string}, or {error: string} with status 400/429/502/503.
- IMAGES: POST /api/ai with JSON {mode: "image", prompt: string} → responds {imageBase64: string} — a REAL PNG. Render it as <img src={\`data:image/png;base64,\${imageBase64}\`} alt="…" />. Image generation takes 5–20 seconds: show a clear loading state. Images have a SMALLER daily limit than text.
- NEVER ask the text mode to produce an image, base64, SVG-as-text, or any binary data — language models cannot generate valid images; always use mode:"image" for pictures.
- Do NOT store generated images in localStorage (a few images exceed the 5 MB quota and break the app) — keep at most the latest image in component state, and offer a download link (anchor with the data URL and a download attribute) if the user should keep it.
- Call the endpoint with fetch from client components; always show a loading state while waiting.
- If the response is not ok, display the error message to the user politely (daily limits exist — 429 means "come back tomorrow").
- Keep prompts under 4000 characters. Craft a good "system" string so text answers fit this app's purpose and audience.
- NEVER call OpenAI or any external AI service directly, never reference API keys, and never modify src/app/api/ai/route.ts.
- In tests, mock global.fetch for /api/ai calls — never let tests hit the network.`;

When finished, reply with one short paragraph explaining the cause and the fix.

Known failure signatures:
- "next build" failing while prerendering /404, /500, or /_error with "<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document": a component threw during server prerendering — almost always window or localStorage accessed at module scope, in a useState initializer, or during render. Find that component and move the access into useEffect. Do NOT create 404.tsx/500.tsx/_document/_error files; they are not valid in the App Router and will not fix this.

- The "e2e" step failing: this is the locked browser test (e2e/smoke.spec.ts, NOT editable). Its failure messages name the exact problem: "JavaScript errors" or "missing files (404)" mean an app bug — fix the component or remove the reference to the nonexistent file; "accessibility violations" list axe rule ids — fix the offending components (add labels/alt text, increase color contrast, correct heading structure). Never try to modify or skip the browser test itself.

Escalation rule: if an earlier attempt this build already rewrote the SAME test file for the same failing test, do not rewrite it again with cleverer queries — that strategy has failed. Instead either (a) fix the COMPONENT: races between effects and assertions, duplicated text without distinguishing roles/labels, state that briefly flickers through wrong values on mount — these are component bugs even when the error appears in a test; or (b) SIMPLIFY the test: delete the brittle assertions and keep only robust role/label-based checks of core behavior. A shorter passing test beats a thorough flaky one.
