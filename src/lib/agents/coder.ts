const SHARED_RULES = `Rules for all files you write:
- This is a Next.js 15 App Router project with TypeScript (strict) and Tailwind CSS 4. React 19.
- You may ONLY write files under src/app/, src/components/, and src/lib/, with .ts or .tsx extensions, via the write_file tool. package.json, configs, and src/app/globals.css are locked — the project's dependencies CANNOT be changed, so import only: react, next (next/link, next/image, next/navigation), and files you write yourself.
- The app must work entirely in the browser: no databases, no API keys, no external services. If data must persist, use localStorage inside client components ("use client") with a typed wrapper in src/lib/storage.ts.
- CRITICAL: every page is prerendered on the server at build time, where window/localStorage do not exist. Never touch window or localStorage at module scope, in useState initializers, or during render — ONLY inside useEffect. Initialize state to defaults, then load saved data in a useEffect after mount.
- Do not create pages/, src/pages/, 404.tsx, 500.tsx, _document, or _app files — this is App Router only (use not-found.tsx / error.tsx if genuinely needed).
- Style with Tailwind utility classes only. Mobile-first, readable, generous touch targets. The app is used by non-technical family members.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, labels on inputs, alt text, keyboard operability.
- Write tests: for each main feature, add a *.test.tsx or *.test.ts file under src/ using vitest + @testing-library/react (both installed; jest-dom matchers like toBeInTheDocument are set up). Tests must not rely on localStorage persisting between tests.
- Tests must be deterministic: NEVER use vi.useFakeTimers, real delays, or arbitrary waits. Never use setTimeout/setInterval in components for game or app logic — apply state updates synchronously (skip artificial "thinking" pauses; they break tests and add nothing). In tests prefer userEvent/fireEvent then findBy*/waitFor.
- Do not overwrite src/lib/template.test.ts.
- src/app/layout.tsx already exists with correct metadata; only rewrite it if the app truly needs a different shell, and keep the import of "./globals.css".
- Every page must compile under strict TypeScript and pass eslint (next/core-web-vitals). No unused variables, no explicit any.`;

Known failure signatures:
- "next build" failing while prerendering /404, /500, or /_error with "<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document": a component threw during server prerendering — almost always window or localStorage accessed at module scope, in a useState initializer, or during render. Find that component and move the access into useEffect. Do NOT create 404.tsx/500.tsx/_document/_error files; they are not valid in the App Router and will not fix this.
